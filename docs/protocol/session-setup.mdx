Sessions represent a specific conversation or thread between the [Client](./overview#client) and [Agent](./overview#agent). Each session maintains its own context, conversation history, and state, allowing multiple independent interactions with the same Agent.

Before creating a session, Clients **MUST** first complete the [initialization](./initialization) phase to establish protocol compatibility and capabilities.

## Creating a Session

Clients create a new session by calling the `session/new` method with:

- The [working directory](#working-directory) for the session
- A list of [MCP servers](#mcp-servers) the Agent should connect to

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "session/new",
  "params": {
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "filesystem",
        "command": "/path/to/mcp-server",
        "args": ["--stdio"],
        "env": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The Agent **MUST** respond with a unique [Session ID](#session-id) that identifies this conversation:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456"
  }
}
```

## Loading Sessions

Agents that support the `loadSession` capability allow Clients to resume previous conversations. This feature enables persistence across restarts and sharing sessions between different Client instances.

### Checking Support

Before attempting to load a session, Clients **MUST** verify that the Agent supports this capability by checking the `loadSession` field in the `initialize` response:

```json highlight={7}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "agentCapabilities": {
      "loadSession": true
    }
  }
}
```

If `loadSession` is `false` or not present, the Agent does not support loading sessions and Clients **MUST NOT** attempt to call `session/load`.

### Loading a Session

To load an existing session, Clients **MUST** call the `session/load` method with:

- The [Session ID](#session-id) to resume
- [MCP servers](#mcp-servers) to connect to
- The [working directory](#working-directory)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "session/load",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_789xyz",
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "filesystem",
        "command": "/path/to/mcp-server",
        "args": ["--mode", "filesystem"],
        "env": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The Agent **MUST** replay the entire conversation to the Client in the form of `session/update` notifications (like `session/prompt`).

For example, a user message from the conversation history:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_789xyz",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "user_message_chunk",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "What's the capital of France?"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Followed by the agent's response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_789xyz",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "agent_message_chunk",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "The capital of France is Paris."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When **all** the conversation entries have been streamed to the Client, the Agent **MUST** respond to the original `session/load` request.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

The Client can then continue sending prompts as if the session was never interrupted.

## Session ID

The session ID returned by `session/new` is a unique identifier for the conversation context.

Clients use this ID to:

- Send prompt requests via `session/prompt`
- Cancel ongoing operations via `session/cancel`
- Load previous sessions via `session/load` (if the Agent supports the `loadSession` capability)

## Working Directory

The `cwd` (current working directory) parameter establishes the file system context for the session. This directory:

- **MUST** be an absolute path
- **MUST** be used for the session regardless of where the Agent subprocess was spawned
- **SHOULD** serve as a boundary for tool operations on the file system

## MCP Servers

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](//modelcontextprotocol.io) allows Agents to access external tools and data sources. When creating a session, Clients **MAY** include connection details for MCP servers that the Agent should connect to.

Each MCP server specification includes:

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  A human-readable identifier for the server
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="command" type="string" required>
  The path to the MCP server executable
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="args" type="array" required>
  Command-line arguments to pass to the server
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="env" type="EnvVariable[]">
  Environment variables to set when launching the server

  <Expandable title="EnvVariable">
      <ParamField path="name" type="string">
        The name of the environment variable.
      </ParamField>
      <ParamField path="value" type="string">
        The value of the environment variable.
      </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>


Agents **SHOULD** connect to all MCP servers specified by the Client.

Clients **MAY** use this ability to provide tools directly to the underlying language model by including their own MCP server.
