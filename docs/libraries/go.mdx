The [`github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go)
package provides implementations of both sides of the Agent Client Protocol that
you can use to build your own agent server or client.

To get started, add the module to your project:

```bash
go get github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go@latest
```

Depending on what kind of tool you're building, you'll create either the
[AgentSideConnection](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go#NewAgentSideConnection)
or the
[ClientSideConnection](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go#NewClientSideConnection)
and implement the corresponding interfaces (`Agent`, `Client`).

You can find example implementations of both sides in the
[main repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/tree/main/go/example).
These can be run from your terminal or connected to external ACP agents, making
them great starting points for your own integration!

Browse the Go package docs on
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/go)
for detailed API documentation.

For a complete, production-ready implementation of an ACP agent, see the
[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) which exposes an ACP
interface. The Go example client demonstrates connecting to it via stdio.
